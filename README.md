# CryptoClustering

# CryptoClustering - Unsupervised Learning Project

### Overview
This project uses Python and unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering, PCA) to analyze cryptocurrency price changes and identify patterns based on 24-hour and 7-day trends.

### Key Tasks
* Data Preprocessing: Normalize cryptocurrency market data using StandardScaler().

* Optimal K-Value Selection: Use the elbow method to determine the best number of clusters (k).

* K-Means Clustering: Group cryptocurrencies based on price trends.

* PCA Optimization: Reduce dimensionality and compare clustering results.

* Visualization: Generate scatter plots using hvPlot.

### Files
* Crypto_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.

* crypto_market_data.csv: Dataset with cryptocurrency price change metrics.

### Instructions
1. Data Preparation
* Load crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.

* Normalize data using StandardScaler().

* Set coin_id as the index.

2. Finding the Best K-Value (Elbow Method)
* Compute inertia for k = 1 to 11.

* Plot the elbow curve to determine the optimal k.

3. K-Means Clustering (Original Data)
* Fit a K-Means model using the best k.

* Predict clusters and visualize using hvPlot:

* X-axis: price_change_percentage_24h

* Y-axis: price_change_percentage_7d

* Color: Cluster labels

* Hover: coin_id

4. Optimizing with PCA
* Reduce features to 3 principal components.

* Check explained variance.

* Repeat K-Means clustering on PCA-transformed data.

* Compare results with the original clusters.

5. Composite Visualization
* Plot both original and PCA clusters side-by-side.

* Analyze the impact of dimensionality reduction.

### Key Questions Answered
* What is the best k value for the original and PCA data?

* How much variance is explained by the first 3 principal components?

* What is the impact of using fewer features (PCA) on clustering?
